# To-Do
To-Do in its various implementations is a common and popular software among users. 
To-Do allows users to keep a list of everyday tasks and mark their progress.

## To-Do website
This repository contains the To-Do website project written in the Flask framework. 
Along with the integrated functionality of the framework, the Flask-Login package is also used. 
The project consists of several dynamic pages: 
user registration and authorization, creating and changing tasks, viewing all tasks for user.

This Flask-project is my second To-Do website implementation. 
The first implementation was written by me in the Django framework and hosted.
The web-version on Django is available at the link: https://www.iliasamodin.ru/to-do/

## Why was this project written
The purpose of writing two identical projects on different frameworks 
was a detailed comparison of the functional features of the frameworks, 
honing development skills and increasing competencies as a Python developer.
